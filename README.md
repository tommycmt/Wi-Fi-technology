## WLAN Channel

### 2.4GHz
  - 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ax
  - To prevent the overlapping between channels, in most of the countries, 3 channels will be used
  - channel 1, 6, 11

  - Relative lower speed
  - Better penetration on different materials, longer distance and more stable
  - Many other technologies are using 2.4GHz also, e.g. bluebooth, Microwave oven, wireless microphones
  - Interference would be a problem

### 5GHz
  - 802.11a, 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax
  - Much more channels and provide more choice on the bandwidth, 20, 40, 80, 160Mhz
  - The wider bandwidth, the faster data transmission rate

  - 
  - Providing a faster transmission rate
  - But relative shorter distance and weaker penetration on obstacle
